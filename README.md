This was completed with a group of students including 3 other people. This was our final project for our Software Design and Data Structures Class in java. I was responsible for all of the logic in the calculation related classes and for formatting the GUI. This project took around three weeks to complete and take in any csv file following the format of the ones included in this project. We were also required to include JUnit classes to ensure that our code worked properly.
